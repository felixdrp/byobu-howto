[Byobu](http://byobu.co/byobu.wav) is a light, powerful, text-based window manager based on [GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/). Using Byobu, you can quickly create and move between different windows over a single SSH connection or TTY terminal, monitor dozens of important statistics about your system, detach and reattach to sessions later while your programs continue to run in the background.
